# My Dream Setup as a Front-End Developer (May 2016)


### An application launcher

  A tool like [Alfred][1], with which I can launch applications and find files with a few key strokes. 

### A screen resizer

  A tool similar to [Spectacle][2], with which move and resize windows with ease.

### A User-Friendly Terminal and Shell

  A terminal like [iTerm 2][3] and a Shell program as good as [Oh My ZSH][4].   In this environment, I can always tell the current location, path, the source-control status of each of my files. 

  I will be able to work directly with Git in this terminal

### A build system with browser-sync

  I wish for a build system like Webpack + browser-sync that offers these features:

  1.  Compile and watch scss files
  1.  Compile and watch JS files
  1.  Watch HTML files
  1.  Lint SCSS/CSS
  1.  Lint JS
  1.  Transpile ES6 and ES7
  1.  Bundle and uglify JS and CSS files
  1.  Execute unit tests
  1.  Synchrone my URLs, so I can access/test multiple devces


### A Modern Code Editor 

  I wish for a light-weight code editor as versatal as Sublime Text or Atom
